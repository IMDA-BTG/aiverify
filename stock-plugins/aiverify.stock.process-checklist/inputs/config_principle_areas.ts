Explainability is an important component of a transparent AI system. The testable criteria in this section focus on system-enabled explainability. However, it may not be possible to provide an explanation for how a black box model generated a particular output or decision (and what combination of input factors contributed to that). In these circumstances, other explainability measures may be required (e.g., accountability and transparent communication). As state-of-the-art approaches to explainability become available, users should refine the process, metrics, and/or thresholds accordingly.",
