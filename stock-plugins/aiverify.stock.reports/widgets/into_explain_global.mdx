Global explainability attempts to explain the feature contributions of a model. It computes an average value of each feature across all predictions, giving an idea of the most important features that influenced the predictions.

This type of explanation is typically used by AI system designers and model owners. From this, they are able to determine each featureâ€™s contribution to the predictions, which is helpful for tracing and tweaking the model if necessary. It is also useful for AI system owners, who may be required to understand how the model makes decisions, but do not know the technicalities of the AI system.

In this report, the global explainability graphs are generated by SHAP.
