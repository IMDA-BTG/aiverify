    <h3>Fairness for Regression</h3>
    The fairness test shows how correctly your model has predicted the selected sensitive feature(s) (Selected: {props.getResults(cid).sensitive_feature.join(", ")}). These fairness metrics are calculated based on the error measurements for regression models. The table shows a list of fairness metrics that are generated in this report. In the case of all regression  fairness metrics, a lower parity value indicates a better outcome.
