It is a non-parametric method for testing whether samples originate from the same distribution.\n\nThe Spearman rank-order correlation coefficient is a nonparametric measure of the monotonicity of the relationship between two datasets. The p-value roughly indicates the probability of an uncorrelated system producing datasets that have a Spearman correlation at least as extreme as the one computed from these datasets.\n\n",
